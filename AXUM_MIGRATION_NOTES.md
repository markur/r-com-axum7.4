# Axum 0.7.4 Migration Fix

## Problem
The compilation was failing with these errors:
```
error[E0432]: unresolved import `axum::Server`
error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `Server` in `axum`
error[E0599]: no method named `into_make_service` found for struct `Router<Arc<AppState>>`
```

## Root Cause
The code was written for Axum 0.6 API but the Cargo.toml specifies Axum 0.7.4, which has breaking changes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed `axum::Server` import
**Why**: `axum::Server` was completely removed in Axum 0.7+
**Fix**: Added `tokio::net::TcpListener` import instead

### 2. Updated server startup pattern
**Old Pattern (Axum 0.6)**:
```rust
axum::Server::bind(&addr)
    .serve(app.into_make_service())
    .await
    .unwrap();
```

**New Pattern (Axum 0.7+)**:
```rust
let listener = TcpListener::bind(&addr).await.unwrap();
axum::serve(listener, app)
    .await
    .unwrap();
```

**Why**: 
- `axum::Server::bind()` no longer exists
- `into_make_service()` method was removed - Router can be passed directly
- Must manually create TcpListener and pass to `axum::serve()`

### 3. Fixed missing imports in admin_products.rs
**Problem**: Code had comment "// Removed unused imports: post, delete" but these imports are actually used in the router
**Fix**: Re-added `post` and `delete` to the routing imports

## Benefits of Axum 0.7+
- Simplified API - no need for `into_make_service()`
- Better performance with direct TcpListener usage
- More consistent with tokio ecosystem patterns
- Improved error handling and debugging

## Testing
After these changes, the Docker build should complete successfully without the previous compilation errors.
